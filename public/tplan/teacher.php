     <h4>Ben Foster, PE Development Officer</h4>
    <p>Having worked in Primary school PE for the past seven years, I am always on the lookout for teaching resources that provide fresh and stimulating activities.  PE Planning enables me to access a range of sports with so many activities for each.  The way they have linked their activities to the National Curriculum is very reassuring, it is the best resource I have found by far. </p>

    <h4>Laura Cawood, Year 3 Teacher - Princeville Primary School</h4>
    <p>PE Planning has made a massive difference to me and my class.  I can now give my class high quality PE lessons with very little subject knowledge, I found the set plan option suited me better at first but now I create my own unique lessons using the custom option, I had no idea I could teach my class what a ‘fling throw’ is!! This resource has enabled me to teach PE with confidence.</p>

    <h4>Jessica Baker, PE Coach - Thornbury Primary School</h4>
    <p>I am a PE Coach currently working in a primary school teaching from Reception pupils through to Year 6.  The PE Planning website is very useful as it provides a huge range of activity options in different sports.  It allows me to differentiate between plans through picking and choosing which activities I want to do, as well enabling me to ensure I am reaching the appropriate National Curriculum level for each particular class.</p>

    <h4>Jenna Mudd Victoria Primary School</h4>
    <p>PE planning gives me confidence to teach sports which I know very little about, the endless amount of activities means I can keep PE fresh and engaging.</po>
