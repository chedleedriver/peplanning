Many report much more focused lessons in which the children are learning new skills and having fun. Hence the teachers are enjoying teaching PE more than they have before."</p>

It provides a brilliant and innovative resource for any adult teaching PE, whatever their level of expertise. It allows teachers to produce tailor made high quality PE planning with a wide range of fun sports activities that really work in practice with the children. It is quick and easy to use and can save hours of planning time. The expert advice and specialist knowledge within the lesson plans ensure that teachers can plan for differentiation and progression. I would highly recommend the website as a planning tool for PE."</p>

This led to differing quality PE lessons being delivered across the school, with no clear progression. The planning was often old and mixed quality. Since using PE planning the whole school PE curriculum has been reviewed and revitalised and the change has been amazing. PE planning has provided a whole range of topics that can be planned as blocks with all the hard work done. The planning topics range from foundation to level 4 and enable the teachers to have plans at their finger tips which are clearly laid out for the time span they need, with all the information necessary to deliver exciting, differentiated lessons and include clear progression and assessment. Feedback from across all Key stages has been incredibly positive. I would highly recommend the site to any school and it is excellent value for money.”</p>
